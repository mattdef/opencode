description: Implement the next self-contained sub-task from the plan.
---

Read `.opencode/plan.md` and select the active sub-task using this order: continue the single sub-task marked `In Progress`; 
otherwise take the first sub-task marked `Pending`.
If multiple sub-tasks are marked `In Progress`, stop and ask which one to continue.
If there is no `In Progress` or `Pending` sub-task, stop and report that the plan has no remaining implementation work.
Treat the selected sub-task entry as the full implementation brief.
If the selected sub-task was `Pending`, update it to `In Progress` before coding.
Implement only that sub-task, following its related requirements, dependencies, in-scope and out-of-scope notes, risks, implementation suggestions,
testing guidance, and done-when criteria.
After implementation, ask the `@executor` sub-agent to run the relevant validation, then ask the `@reviewer` sub-agent to review the changes.
The `@reviewer` sub-agent will write feedback to `.opencode/review.md`.
Fix any issues you agree with, ask the `@executor` sub-agent to re-run the relevant validation after fixes,
and then update `.opencode/plan.md` to mark the sub-task `Completed`.
